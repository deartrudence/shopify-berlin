These can add further sales opportunities and complement your already existing Shopify store. Also, if you don’t have a full online store and/or you only want to sell a few products on a site that already exists, you can even get a pared down version of Shopify that is only $9 per month and use just the Buy Button Channel.</p>\\n<p>Going to <code>SALES CHANNEL > Buy Button</code> will bring you to the 3 options:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://d1o9o9r2qlybfc.cloudfront.net/contain/900/600/b5a75a87-ed67-45ea-ab37-d784735b507d.png\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>1. Embed a product in email</strong></p>\\n<p>This option allows you to choose a product and add a link into emails that will allow recipients to purchase it directly from their email. Shopify will create the link to embed and track the inventory and revenue.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Buy Button</strong></p>\\n<p>This option allows you to choose a product or collection.  Once you’ve made your selection, you’ll be brought to a page that will allow you to customize your buy button.  You’ll be able to choose fonts, colours, layout and cart options.  Once you’ve created the look that you want, click the “Generate Code” button and Shopify will provide you with an embed code.  Put this embed code in your already existing website and people will be able to purchase your product there!</p>\\n<p><strong>3. JavaScript Buy SDK</strong></p>\\n<p>The buy button provides a lot of options for customization, but you might find that you want to be able to make a completely unique experience for your customers from within your existing website. This is where the JavaScript Buy SDK comes in.  The JS SDK is a lightweight library that allows you to build e-commerce into any website. It is based on Shopify’s API and provides the ability to retrieve products and collections from your shop, add products to a cart, and checkout. </p>\\n<p>The API allows you to pull products into your site, create a cart experience and insert a link to the Shopify checkout.</p>\\n<h2>Admin API</h2>\\n<h2>The Admin API</h2>\\n<p>This is the most complete of the Shopify APIs and requires authentication. Its great for building Shopify apps. You can read up on all of the available actions and endpoints in the <a href=\\\"https://help.shopify.com/api/reference\\\">API Reference</a>.</p>\\n<h2>The Shopify AJAX API</h2>\\n<p>Though all of the APIs we are going to discuss today can be called using an ajax request this one has the request explicitly in the name. The Ajax API is great for use in theme development as it allows you to access certain actions for a limited number of endpoints, but there is no need to authenticate so you can interact with the API entirely on the client side. </p>\\n<p>Here is a list of the available endpoints:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>GET /products.json</li>\\n<li>GET /products/&#x3C;\\\\product-handle>.js</li>\\n<li>POST /cart/add.js</li>\\n<li>GET /cart.js</li>\\n<li>POST /cart/update.js</li>\\n<li>POST /cart/change.js</li>\\n<li>POST /cart/clear.js</li>\\n<li>GET /cart/shipping_rates.json</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Essentially, using the Ajax API you can complete actions involved in updating and retrieving cart information and also accessing base information about products. This can allow you to add functionality like automatic cart updates, product filtering (on certain parameters), estimated shipping rates, etc.</p>\\n<h3>Exercise : Ajax Shipping Cost Estimates on the Cart Page</h3>\\n<p>To test out the potential of the Ajax API we are going to create a shipping cost estimating form on the cart page. This will allow customers to see the approximate shipping costs based on their items and location and can help reduce abandoned carts when they are surprised with the shipping costs on the checkout page :). </p>\\n<p><strong>/cart/shipping_rates.json</strong></p>\\n<p>There are a couple of different parameters you can pass to the get request for your store’s shipping rates in order to get an accurate shipping rate estimate. </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>shipping_address[zip]</strong> - the zip code or postal code for the shipping address</li>\\n<li><strong>shipping_address[country]</strong> - the country you are having the product shipped to</li>\\n<li><strong>shipping_address[province]</strong> - the province / state the product is being shipped to</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This will return all shipping options for that address. So for example if in the Shopify admin you have entered the option for standard and express shipping in Canada and the customer enters a canadian address the returned data will include the details for both the standard and express shipping. </p>\\n<p>Here is a sample response with two available shipping options:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://d1o9o9r2qlybfc.cloudfront.net/contain/900/600/2a705f3a-652d-45f1-89ba-cd97f9600b3c.png\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Creating the Shipping Info Form</strong>\\nOn the cart page of your site create a new form that asks the customer for their postal code, country, and province / state. </p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;div class=\\\"shipping-calculator\\\">\\n    &#x3C;form id=\\\"shipping-calculator\\\">\\n        &#x3C;label for=\\\"zip\\\">Postal / Zip Code&#x3C;/label>\\n        &#x3C;input type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"zip\\\" id=\\\"zip\\\">\\n        &#x3C;label for=\\\"country\\\">Country&#x3C;/label>\\n        &#x3C;input type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"country\\\" id=\\\"country\\\">\\n        &#x3C;label for=\\\"province\\\">Province / State&#x3C;/label>\\n        &#x3C;input type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"province\\\" id=\\\"province\\\">\\n        &#x3C;input type=\\\"submit\\\" value=\\\"check shipping rate\\\">\\n    &#x3C;/form>\\n&#x3C;/div>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You can put this anywhere on your cart page. </p>\\n<p><strong>Setting up your AJAX request to get shipping info</strong>\\nNext, create a function called <strong>getShippingRate</strong> that takes in one parameter, an object with all the data passed from the form you just created. </p>\\n<p>Using jQuery, here is what the code would look like to make a request to the shipping rates endpoint from your store.</p>\\n<pre><code>$.ajax({\\n    Type: ‘GET’,\\n    url: '/cart/shipping_rates.json', \\n    dataType: 'json', \\n    data: {\\n        'shipping_address[zip]': the_zip_or_postal_code, \\n        'shipping_address[country]' : the_country, \\n        'shipping_address[province]' : the_state_or_province\\n    }, \\n        success: (res) => {\\n        console.log(res)\\n    },\\n        error: (err) => {\\n        console.log(err)\\n    }\\n\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Swap out <em>the<em>zip</em>or<em>postal</em>code</em>, <em>the_country</em>, and <em>the<em>state</em>or_province</em> for each respective value passed in through the data object.</p>\\n<p><strong>Listen for form submit and call getShippingRate</strong>\\nInside of your document ready function create a new listener for the submit of your shipping calculator form. </p>\\n<pre><code>$('#shipping-calculator').on('submit', function(e) {\\n        // prevent page refresh on form submit\\n        e.preventDefault()\\n\\n        //select the form and serialize the form data\\n        var form = $(this)\\n        var form_data = form.serializeArray()\\n        var data = {};\\n\\n        $(form_data).each(function(index, obj){\\n            data[obj.name] = obj.value;\\n        });\\n\\n        // pass the form data to the getShippingRate function to make the Ajax request\\n        getShippingRate(data)\\n\\n        $(form)[0].reset()\\n\\n    })\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Create an element to append the shipping rate results to</strong>\\nInside the shipping calculator div add the following:</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;div id=\\\"shipping-estimate\\\">&#x3C;/div>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now, in the success function for the ajax request in <strong>getShippingRate</strong>, append the shipping rate to the newly created shipping-estimate div:</p>\\n<pre><code>success: (res) => {\\n            console.log(res)\\n            $('#shipping-estimate').html('&#x3C;p>the estimated shipping cost for current items is $' + res.shipping_rates[0].price + '&#x3C;/p>' )\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong><em>BONUS</em></strong> Modify the success function to account for multiple shipping rate possibilities and display all possible shipping rate options to the customer. </p>\\n<p><strong><em>BONUS 2</em></strong> Account for if no items have been added to the cart and therefore there is no shipping rate information available. </p>\\n<p>Download sample answers for this exercise <a href=\\\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/shopify-hy/2.3-ajax-shipping-cost-estimates-on-cart-page.zip\\\">2.3-ajax-for-estimated-shipping-costs</a></p>\\n<h2>Other APIs available on Shopify</h2>\\n<h3>The Analytics API</h3>\\n<p>This API is only available to shops on the<a href=\\\"https://www.shopify.ca/pricing\\\"> Advanced Shopify Plan</a>.
